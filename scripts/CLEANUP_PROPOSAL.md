# ✅ CLEANUP COMPLETED

## What Was Done

The scripts directory has been successfully rationalized and consolidated.

## Final Structure

### Core Scripts (5 files)
- `meilisearch-test-suite.ps1` - **Main consolidated test framework** ⭐
- `run-core-tests.ps1` - Legacy test runner (for compatibility)
- `url-checker.ps1` - Quick URL health checker
- `test-actual-worker.ps1` - Worker-specific test
- `integration-test.ps1` - Comprehensive integration test

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Complete usage guide for all scripts
- `CLEANUP_PROPOSAL.md` - This file (cleanup summary)

### Archived (moved to `archived/` folder)
All duplicate, outdated, and setup-specific scripts:
- Setup scripts (cloudflare-token-setup.ps1, dns-setup-guide.ps1, etc.)
- Duplicate test scripts (test-gateway.ps1, comprehensive-test-updated.ps1, etc.)
- Debug/analysis scripts (500-error-analysis.ps1, deployment-fix-summary.ps1, etc.)
- Secrets management scripts (consolidated into main suite)

## Key Improvements

1. **Single Entry Point**: `meilisearch-test-suite.ps1` provides all testing functionality
2. **Reduced Complexity**: From 26+ scripts down to 5 core scripts
3. **Better Organization**: Clear separation between active and archived scripts
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Health, search, auth, and deployment tests in one place
5. **Documentation**: Complete README with usage examples

## Usage

For most testing needs:
```powershell
# Quick health check (recommended)
.\meilisearch-test-suite.ps1 -Health

# Complete test suite
.\meilisearch-test-suite.ps1 -All
```

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The Meilisearch scripts directory is now clean, organized, and ready for production use.
