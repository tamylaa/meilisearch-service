## 1. Overview
The `meilisearch` service is a Cloudflare Worker that provides a secure gateway and integration layer to a Meilisearch instance. It offers index management, secured search, add/update/delete document operations with user isolation, and health monitoring.

Key files:
- `src/index.ts` — main Worker implementation and endpoints
- `src/auth.ts` — JWT utilities and authentication
- `wrangler.toml` — Cloudflare Worker configuration
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — CI/CD automation
- `docs/github-actions-setup.md` — secrets and deployment setup

---

## 2. Full Functionality
### Endpoints (Cloudflare Worker)
- `POST /setup` — Configure and initialize index settings (searchable, filterable, sortable attributes).
- `GET /search` — Full-text search with support for query (`q`), filters (`filter`), and facets (`facets`). Highlights search results.
- `POST /documents` — Add or update documents. The Worker enforces `userId` assignment from the authenticated token.
- `DELETE /documents` — Delete documents by IDs. Only documents owned by the authenticated user are removed.
- `GET /health` — Public health check endpoint.

### Internal Service Methods
- `addOrUpdateDocuments(docs: DocumentMetadata[])` — Add/update documents in the Meili index.
- `deleteDocuments(ids: string[], userId: string)` — Ownership-checked deletion.
- `searchDocuments(query: string, userId: string, filters?: string, facets?: string[])` — Applies automatic `userId` filter to all searches.
- `setupIndex()` — Configure index attributes for search and filters.

### Environment & Config
- Uses env vars: `MEILISEARCH_HOST`, `MEILISEARCH_API_KEY` (admin), `MEILISEARCH_SEARCH_KEY` (search), `AUTH_JWT_SECRET`.
- `package.json` scripts: `build` (TypeScript compile), `deploy:staging`, `deploy:production`.
- CI/CD: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs build and deploys to Cloudflare via Wrangler.

## 3. Authentication & Security Model
- `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` is expected as a Worker secret. The service uses the same JWT strategy as other platform services.
- `src/auth.ts` implements:
  - `extractToken()` — supports Authorization Bearer header, cookies, and `token` query param.
  - `verifyToken()` — Web Crypto API (HMAC-SHA256) verification.
  - `authenticateRequest()` — returns standardized auth result (`{ success, user, error }`).
- Worker requires JWT for all sensitive endpoints (`/search`, `/documents`, `/delete`).
- Automatic user isolation:
  - Search queries are always filtered by authenticated `userId` (preventing cross-user data leakage).
  - Document creation forces `userId` to the authenticated user's id (prevents client spoofing).
  - Deletions are performed only after verifying ownership.

Security rationale:
- Local JWT verification avoids round-trips to the auth service for every request and reduces latency.
- Centralizing ownership enforcement in the Worker reduces risk compared to distributing admin API keys across multiple services.

## 4. Integration with `content-skimmer`
There are two supported integration patterns; choose based on trust model and operational preferences.

### A. Direct indexing (content-skimmer → Meili server)
- `content-skimmer` may use a `MeilisearchProvider` that calls the Meili HTTP API (`/indexes/<index>/documents`) directly using `MEILISEARCH_API_KEY`.
- Suitable for trusted internal services that can hold admin API keys securely.
- Responsibility: `content-skimmer` must ensure correct `userId` when indexing.

### B. Worker gateway (recommended): content-skimmer → `meilisearch` Worker → Meili server
- `content-skimmer` posts to the Worker (`POST /documents`) with a JWT representing the user or service account.
- Worker authenticates the request, overrides `userId`, and uses `MEILISEARCH_API_KEY` to index.
- Advantages: centralizes auth, ownership enforcement, logging, metrics, and reduces admin key distribution.

### Typical flow (event-driven indexing)
1. File uploaded to `content-store-service` (owner authenticated).
2. `content-store-service` calls `data-service` to persist metadata.
3. `data-service` emits an event (or webhook), `content-skimmer` consumes it, analyzes the content, and calls `meilisearch` Worker to index results.

---

## 5. Integration with `data-service`
- `data-service` is the canonical metadata store (D1). It enforces JWT auth and stores file metadata (owner, storage path, status).
- Sync patterns:
  - **Event-driven**: `data-service` emits events on metadata changes; `content-skimmer` picks them up and indexes via the Worker.
  - **Direct calls**: `data-service` could call the Worker to trigger indexing (requires service token/JWT).
- Query-time interactions: frontends may call `data-service` for metadata and the `meilisearch` Worker for search results, joining results client-side or server-side.

## 6. Operational & Deployment Notes
- CI/CD: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` performs TypeScript build and deploys to Cloudflare using `cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3`.
- Required GitHub secrets (configure in repo settings):
  - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
  - `MEILISEARCH_HOST`, `MEILISEARCH_API_KEY`, `MEILISEARCH_SEARCH_KEY`
  - `AUTH_JWT_SECRET`
- Use `wrangler` for local testing: `npm run dev` (as configured) or `npm run build` plus `wrangler deploy`.

---

## 7. Edge Cases & Recommendations
- If `content-skimmer` indexes Meili directly (admin key), ensure admin key is not exposed to clients or logged.
- Prefer Worker gateway for centralized policy and auditability.
- Add rate limiting and pagination on `/search` to protect against abuse and large queries.
- If multi-tenant (org-level) isolation is needed, adopt a tenant filter alongside `userId`.
- Use durable retry (queue or dead-letter) for indexing failures to ensure eventual consistency.

## 8. Quick Examples
Example search (Worker gateway):

```http
GET /search?q=invoice&filter=status="final"&facets=topics
Authorization: Bearer <user-jwt>
```

Example index document (Worker gateway):

```http
POST /documents
Authorization: Bearer <user-jwt>
Content-Type: application/json

[{
  "id": "doc_123",
  "title": "Monthly Invoice",
  "summary": "Summary...",
  "entities": ["company"],
  "topics": ["billing"],
  "userId": "(will be overridden by the Worker)",
  "filename": "invoice.pdf",
  "mimeType": "application/pdf",
  "uploadedAt": "...",
  "lastAnalyzed": "..."
}]
```

---

## 9. Next Steps
- Decide canonical indexing path (direct vs Worker gateway). Recommendation: Worker gateway.
- Add pagination, autocomplete, and analytics endpoints to Worker (see `ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md`).
- Add service account JWT conventions for server-to-server operations.
- Deploy CI secrets and run a smoke test using `test-meilisearch-auth.js`.

## Keys and secrets

Short note on MEILISEARCH_API_KEY / meilisearch_api_key:

- `MEILISEARCH_API_KEY` is the admin/master key meant only for the Meilisearch Worker. It must be set as an environment secret and never embedded in client configs.
- `MEILISEARCH_SEARCH_KEY` is a read-only key appropriate for search-only clients if you must bypass the Worker for read-only use; prefer routing reads through the Worker which can enforce user isolation.
- If you don't yet have these keys: generate them from your Meilisearch admin dashboard or use the master key to create scoped keys via Meilisearch `/keys` API. Store them in GitHub Secrets: `MEILISEARCH_HOST`, `MEILISEARCH_API_KEY`, `MEILISEARCH_SEARCH_KEY`.
